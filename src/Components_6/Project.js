The agricultural sector is a central pillar of the Indian economy, but in today's generation productivity or yield has turned out to be a challenge due to reasons like shrinking agricultural lands, and depletion of finite natural resources. Keeping these challenges in mind we have come up with our project with the main aim to design and develop an agricultural monitoring system using wireless sensor network to increase the productivity and quality of farming without observing it for all the time manually.

Internet is almost implemented in every field we come across in daily life, be it engineering, design or digitization. So, why not in agricultural sector too? 
IoT solutions are focused on helping farmers close the supply demand gap, by ensuring high yields, profitability, and protection of the environment. The approach of using IoT technology to ensure optimum application of resources to achieve high crop yields and reduce operational costs is called
precision agriculture.

The Irish have done a lot of research and entered the era of smart agriculture and have proved the world with their impressive success rates. With prominent development of technology around the world, smart agriculture has the potential to be an extremely positive development with ever increasing population and the need to meet their demands.

The project's implementation has been successful, and outcomes have been significant.</p>
